# Prison Admissions in New York 2008 - 2018

Who are in our prisons?

According to a study conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2016, the United States has a prison population of approximately 2.2 million people, firmly cementing the United States as the nation with the highest incarceration rate in the world. To provide some context as to how large this American prison population is, a city with 2.2 million people would be one of the top ten largest cities in the United States (as reference, New York City, which is the most populous city, has a population of 8.6 million).

Because the number of prisoners is so staggering, I wanted to get a better understanding of who the prison population is comprised of. When you think of the traits of a typical prisoner, what comes to mind?

Are they largely male?
Are they of the young adult variety?
Are the people in our prisons monsters who committed the most horrific violent crimes?
Please join me in this exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find out the answer to these questions and more about prison admittees in my home state of New York from 2008 to 2018.
